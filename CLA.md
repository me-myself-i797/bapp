# Bapp Contributor License Agreement v1.0
## Definitions

“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works, such as semiconductor masks.

To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a work “based on” the earlier work.

To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
## Scope
This license applies to any code or other work protected by copyright which you submit to this project via a pull request or any other means. This will be collectively referred to as "your work". It does not apply to forks.  
## General public license grant
You license your work to the general public under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 and, at the licensee's choice, any later version of that license.
## My license grant
You grant me a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide license to use, modify, propogate, convey, convey modified versions of, sublicense and fully exploit, for any purpose including but not limited to commercially, your work.
## Warrenty disclaimer
The work you submit is submitted to me without any warranty, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from malware. Under no circumstances may I hold you liable for any damages caused by the code you submit to me. You may, at your option, add a warrenty to your work; if you do, that warrenty will apply and this warrenty disclaimer will not. You agree that no warranty you add to your work will impose any liability on me.
## Consideration
You agree that any publicity you gain from your contribution to this project is all the consideration that is needed to create a legally binding contract.
## Jurisdiction
In the interest of neutrality, both parties agree that this agreement shall be enforced by the courts of New Hampshire in the United States. In the unlikely event that we become involved in a legal dispute, you agree to pay the cost for me and/or, at my option, my representatives, to travel to New Hampshire to participate in the dispute. Both parties agree that the loser of the dispute shall pay any reasonable legal fees that the winner of the dispute incurs as a result of the dispute if we can afford to.
## Entire agreement
The text of this agreement is the entirety of this agreement. This agreement has no third-party beneficiaries; you and I are this agreement's only parties. Headings are included for clarity but do not form part of this agreement. You agree that any suggestions about potential compensation I made elsewhere on this website were purely speculative in nature and were not the reason for your contribution, and I shall not be liable in the event that I do not pay you any money. This is not an employment agreement; you are not required to perform any work and I am not required to pay you.
