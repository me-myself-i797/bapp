# Bapp Code of Conduct v1.0
## TLDR
If you're more trouble than you're worth, you'll no longer be allowed to participate in the project. I may impose punishments which are within my power, including blocking you on GitHub and removing you from official discussion boards. This code of conduct is not a legally binding contract; I can't sue you for breaking it, nor can I be held liable for failing to effectively enforce it.
## Longer version
### Attack the issue, not the person.
If someone's causing problems, feel free to point out the problems and who's causing them, but don't bring up their personal characteristics unless they're relevant.
### Stay on-topic
Avoid politics and other irrelevant topics. We're making a program here. Anyone, with any political views, is allowed to contribute to this project (unless there's a law which bans us from allowing them to contribute). In addition, in forums outside the scope of the project, contributors may say whatever they want. This code of conduct exists to ensure focus on the project's development, not to enforce your political views.
### Be tolerant and forgiving
Don't blow up over minor issues. Act in good faith and assume others are acting the same way unless there's a lot of evidence otherwise.
