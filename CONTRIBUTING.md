I'm currently not seeking contributions but if you want to contribute anyway, feel free to submit a pull request.  
Since I plan on eventually making money from this, I'll need you to agree to a contributor license agreement before contributing. See CLA.md for details.  
In short, it will let me use your code for any purpose, but you'll still be allowed to use it. Also you won't be liable for any damage caused by your code (since it is my responsibility as this project's maintainer to review your code.)  
Also it would be unfair of me to make all the money so feel free to add a crypto wallet address to your pull request and I may or may not send money to contributors I determine to have contributed significantly if this project ends up being successful.
